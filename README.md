# 🛡️ Microservice Spring Security Project

This project demonstrates a **Spring Boot Microservices Architecture** with **Spring Security**, **JWT Authentication**, **Eureka Service Registry**, and an **API Gateway**. All services are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

## 🌐 Live Demo

- **Frontend (Netlify):** [View Live](https://sprightly-toffee-322be7.netlify.app/login)
- **API Documentation (Postman):** [View on Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/33677881/2sB34cnhJa)
- **Docker Hub:** [ayush4857](https://hub.docker.com/repositories/ayush4857)

> 🕐 Backend can be hosted on AWS EC2 — may take a few seconds to start when idle. Currently, it's running locally, but deployment is possible when needed.

## Best Practices Implemented

✅ **Global Exception Handling** – centralized error handling for all services using `@RestControllerAdvice`.  

✅ **DTO Validation** – input validated with `@Valid` and custom constraints for safer requests.  

✅ **Logging** – SLF4J/Logback logging implemented in controllers and services for easier debugging and monitoring.  

✅ **Containerization** – all microservices containerized with Docker and orchestrated via Docker Compose.  

✅ **Security** – JWT authentication with role-based access control.  

✅ **Microservice Architecture** – separated services with Eureka service discovery and API Gateway routing.  

✅ **Centralized Configuration** – configuration for all microservices managed via **Spring Cloud Config Server**.  

✅ **Actuator Endpoints Exposed** – `/actuator` endpoints available for health, metrics, and monitoring.

## ⚙️ Services Overview

| Service           | Port | Description                      |
|-------------------|------|----------------------------------|
| Eureka Registry   | 8761 | Service Discovery Server         |
| Auth Service      | 1122 | Handles login & registration     |
| User Service      | 8081 | JWT-secured user endpoints       |
| API Gateway       | 5555 | Routes & secures all API traffic |

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via `/auth/api/v1/auth/login`  
2. A JWT token is returned upon successful login  
3. Client sends the token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header  
4. API Gateway validates the token and routes the request to internal services  
5. Secured services process only if the token is valid  

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

All services are containerized and deployed using Docker Compose.
